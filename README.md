### Welcome to an analysis of the power creep in Pokémon.  

The data comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) and [bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/LPBBS) and contains information about all pokémon from generations 1 through 7. The finished report was generated with RStudio and appears in the report folder. You can see the code used to clean the data and produce the plots in the Rmd file.
